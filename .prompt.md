now about the backedn site and all over things frist we ahve to decide the perfect architech for the thisd app all the models all the oprations fo rth save proof and all the detailes and register ,kyc ,and detsiles fiiling recored .... 

we ahev to track the proccess from abckedn as well becuse when user left from the half of the any of the procces so we can after login start form there as well .


so some of the model we need you can laso add or remove this this is a my suiggestion just :
we can map this via uniqe user code or id (those tables)
1. USER proof model (table) whenre we can save the user all proofs as well 
2. user kyc
3. bussiness detsiles 
4. track kyc and registions if need 
5. bank detsiles model 
6. others need if so we can dd this as well . 


so fridst decide those things then we wil lbe exicuet the code sitre flow as well .

listen we have to do this app evry where secure and fully tight and reponsibale .we can check wevry api and verify user is able for this or not may  be via midel where.

=================================================================================

so current my fully project floe is like :

1. the developer and superadmin all redy creted they doednt need any of the kyc or any of the things , those both user creted by developer.
2. also this both user (developer and superadmin) all the apps and feachers access all ready if we crete in fecher any of the app so this access allready have a access this apps for the those both user.


now floe of the my system :

when new user register as a normal user for example mr.kel regiseter as a normal user and then SP(superuser) crete this mrkel as a admin of the once so this have a admin ascces those given by the SP.
so frist time user can register as a normal user.

1. Create Account step whare user enter the things like :
​-> First Name
-> Middle Name
-> Last Name
​-> Email Address
​-> Mobile Number
