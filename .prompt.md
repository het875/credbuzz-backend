nicce all things api is working fine so we have to now move to the next part of the this project ....


the face two is the our model is the multi users and multi puls of the user role like :
1. developer - fully project and all access
2. super admin - fully access of the all the things and al app but not a code side.
3. admin - limited app access and feachers access they given by the super admin as well .
4. clients - this a portal apps and fechers access those given by admin.
5. end user they have a limied access the given by the clients


so this types of the user role and access ...


so here the multipuls of the :  we have a multi puls of the user rel managemant , app , fechers, management as well ......


frist we have to decide the model and crete a once ERp system wherte we can manage this all things as....

into thr this app we manage the apps, ferchers , users roles, and all user mangement as well .....

some of the apps and fechures we have to create like :
for the app and fechures access we crete a testing apps : crete user role, update user role, delete user role, assign app to the user role, assign fechers to the user role, etc ....

then we have to also crete a diffrent diffrent models as well for the user role and app and fechers management as well for ex: userrole, app, fechers, userrole_app_mapping, userrole_fechers_mapping etc, app list , and more... 

so we have to cretea once by once all app s and also we ahev to test this tings as well .
