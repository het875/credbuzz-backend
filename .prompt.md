===============================================================================

now about the backedn site and all over things frist we ahve to decide the perfect architech for the thisd app all the models all the oprations fo rth save proof and all the detailes and register ,kyc ,and detsiles fiiling recored .... 

we ahev to track the proccess from abckedn as well becuse when user left from the half of the any of the procces so we can after login start form there as well .


so some of the model we need you can laso add or remove this this is a my suiggestion just :
we can map this via uniqe user code or id (those tables)
1. USER proof model (table) whenre we can save the user all proofs as well 
2. user kyc
3. bussiness detsiles 
4. track kyc and registions if need 
5. bank detsiles model 
6. others need if so we can dd this as well . 


so fridst decide those things then we wil lbe exicuet the code sitre flow as well .

listen we have to do this app evry where secure and fully tight and reponsibale .we can check wevry api and verify user is able for this or not may  be via midel where.

=================================================================================

so current my fully project floe is like :

1. the developer and superadmin all redy creted they doednt need any of the kyc or any of the things , those both user creted by developer.
2. also this both user (developer and superadmin) all the apps and feachers access all ready if we crete in fecher any of the app so this access allready have a access this apps for the those both user.


now floe of the my system :

when new user register as a normal user for example mr.kel regiseter as a normal user and then SP(superuser) crete this mrkel as a admin of the once so this have a admin ascces those given by the SP.
so frist time user can register as a normal user.

floe from the ui site if uer comes one so what is the flow of this for  ???
1. Create Account step whare user enter the things like :
​-> First Name
-> Middle Name
-> Last Name
​-> Email Address
​-> Mobile Number

see this api also .

============================================================================================
problme 2 :  
Others things is the we left or refresh the under kyc or proccess betwin thr kyc or registaions destiles so whare when we refresh and after login i can see the KYV proccees start from frist step so also resolve this .....

whenevr we left from the kyc or regisations progress so please start from this as well.


also see the thigs when frist time register and login so you redirect to dahsbosrd but whare we have to where redirect the kyc page , if kyc is inprogress or half pager so we have to start a from there we well .

kyc page we have to start from wheuser left.
=============================================================================================
the i login my porteral in two broser with difrest browset with same credintioal so where i can see the both browser i can see the can give me a login asccess as well .

so this think i wanna change with the for ex : if i login in one tab and  then i login into the an other crome profile so this will be logout into  the exsiting profile and login in new profile as well instantly logout into the old loged out.
============================================================================================

when we have to loing so we  the register time we have to save user wise all document as well,
we ahev to save all proff in out midea wise as well. all the proof adhadr, pan, bank details, bussinees  proof , selfe and all.....
============================================================================================
assure the some of the security things :
1. we have to check the every apis we ahve to check the all the apis autorized.
2. we when user will login frist time after all registations an login comlate so whare we can can shoe the njust dashboard blank as well we dont haver to shoie hwre any thinsg ..... where we have to shoe th just massage is the you dont have a any app or feacures access like some king os the massage.
============================================================================================

SOME OF THE CHNAGER INTO THE ERP sytem 
1. frist we have to crete a once dashbord wher we can shoe the all the user those have a register as a normal user as well.
2. dashboard this is the onde od the user mapping and the user app access dashbord this acces by defult wer give to the superuser and thenn this access super user can give others as well.
3. into the the this dashboard this is the user management and yser role managemanr and the user app access management all thinsg dashbord.

now littele bit of the abut the ERP and App acccess. : 
the app and bout the app's feachures how its work.
-> the app is the like we have main app like 1. auth user app 2. kyc 3. bill pay 4. ERP(user role management) like more apps.....
-> now this app have a some of the number id like 1,2,3,4,5,6.........
-> now those app is the defrent difrent fetures like : 
        1. auth user app - feacures like : crete a user , update user , delete user, and uer related access.
        2. KYC app is the like : kyc accept , reject, also send erro or see the KYC proccess , send main if any issue in KYC to user. and mores users kyc related oprations fetures names.
        3. bill pay - feacures like : there the fechures like pay bill all the bil we have to pay and all the things related to the bill pay.
        4. ERP - user role management app - feacures like : user role managemanr , user app access managemanr , user activity log and more things related to the ERP system. also here we can crete the roles and assign the roles to the user as well. we can crete the also the new app and this new app feacurses as well.

now how we can map th those app anf feachures to the user ????
this we can mao via app id and app feacers id as well. so here we can giv e the app and fechers in incremenr id sa well.

so how this work all ower thigs as well. = >we pas sthe all ap sand all the feachures to the superuser and developer so this both user can assign the app and feachures to the admin and client users as well. also this both user can revoke the app and feachures access as well. this ids in we can pass intothe auth token sdo where so when user login so we can pas the all app and feachures id into the token as well. so where we can check the user have a access or not for the any of the app or feachures as well. also the when user send requites to the backend so we can check the user have a access or not for the any of the app or feachures as well. after decode the token as well. 

-> we can save the things by whome this given this access we can save this in db this things in the audit log as well. so where we can track who given this access to whom and when this access given as well.

================================================================================================

here we cereate a some of the new app and aslo new app fechures fir the bill pay and app role management as well.


those all app and feachures we can manage via the ERP system only as well. this we save in db via tables. 

=================================================================================================

intothe wole of the project bacjedn site we have to do the some of the changes as well like :
1. when wny of the erromso we hav to senf the this erro in toteh clear into the api response as well. not the just faild or some king of the massage. intothe frontend where we can show the clear massage as well.
2. we have to check the all apis autorized or not as well.
3. we ahev to all the api sreponse into the same strucutre as well.
4. we have to check the all the api response status code as well.


==================================================================================================

DB related things we have to do the some of the changes as well like :
1. we have to check the all the table have a proper index or not as well.
2. we have to check the all the forein key realtions as well.
3. when we genrate the ner kyc iud so its a to login so we ahve to make this in to teh int + time base as well. so where we can track the kyc id via date and time as well. max lenght 8 char only. (also chekc the others id genrate logic as well.)
4. if we save the user proof intothe difrent difrent table as well. so we have to check the all the table realtions as well. check this things we ahev to save those all user proof into the once table as well. not the diffrent diffrent table as well. also we save localy as well user code folder name wise.
5. we have to check the all the model field lenght as well. if any field lenght is more then we have to reduce those things as well.
6. when we map the user app acccees so this we can save into the table as well. (we can sdave this via mpping user code with app id and fechures id as well and intothe db we can save in list or any other logic as well. also we have to check the all the realtions as well.) wher we have to save by whoes give this access and when this access given as well. by whome this given this access.
7. we dont have to need the dome of the data in encryption mode like bank details , identify proof and more things as well. so we have to check those things as well. just pass word and like this types of the things we have to save in encryption mode only.

==========================================================================================================

add this new things in our backedn frist then frontend as well.
1. we crete a new django app name : bill pay ot payment or any other name as well.
    what is in this app :
    -> bill pay feachures api
        -> bill pay history api
        -> pay bill api
        -> upcoming bill api
        -> manage billers api
        -> save cards api
        -> delete saved cards api
        -> update related oprations 
    -> bank related oprations api
        -> add bank account api
        -> delete bank account api
        -> update bank account api
        -> list bank accounts api
        -> verify bank account api
        -> bank related oprations like ifsc code verify api and more things as well.
        -> money transfer api(this api will be from the third party payment gateway as well.)

HERE WE CAN UPEER BOTH APP WE HAVE TO SAVE ALL THE LOGS ALL THE HISTORY OR ALL OPRATIONS IN TO THE OUR DB THE PAYMENT RELATED AND BILL PAY RELATED AS WELL. THE MAIN THINGS WE HAVE TO SAVE ALL THE TRANSACTION LOGS AS WELL DOESNT MATTER SUCCESS OR FAILD WE HAVE TO SAVE ALL THE TRANSACTION LOGS AS WELL.

now frist we have to decide the frist the models and then we will move to the serializers and views as well. this both payment related and bill pay related oprations so here we have to use the strong security measurs as well. like whenuser go for th rpaymrnt finel step of the payment so where we can ask for the mpin this will creted by user .

now when user crete the mapin so this we can save in encryption mode as well. and askk for the pass when user crete the mpin.

bellow of the oprations into the bank related oprations we have crete those api or vies bussiness logic ofr this.
1. add card 
2. remove card
3. update card
4. list cards
5. verify card (via third party api) via last 4 numbers 
6. bank related oprations like ifsc code verify api and more things as well.

21. payment history api (all payment related history api as well.)
and more things as well.

uper all the api with the filtred and search and pagination as well. intothe all apis.


upeer all the oprations as we ll this is the app fechetrs we can say as well.



now when we pay a bill so where we have a multipuls of the payment gateway so this payment gateway we can shoe those into the when the user enter all detasil so whare we can shoe the all payment gateway option as well. so where user can select any of the payment gateway as well. we ahev to save thise data into the db as well.


into teh the bill pay we ahe a multipuls of the options for th bill pay like :
1. electricity bill pay

4. mobile recharge
5. dth recharge
6. broadband bill pay
